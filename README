FTN-SRIF

Perl extension which enables the parsing of an FTN SRIF (Standard Request
Information File) received by an FTN mailer for what file(s) are being
requested. Also provides a script, ftn-srif, which although it processes only
a limited version of the standard SRIF keywords, does also provide an example
of how to use the module.

Required, neccessary and/or useful modules, etc.:

FTN::Log	Must be a least v0.02, for the 'logging' subroutine as used
		in the ftn-srif script. If not already installed, it can be
		obtained from CPAN (www.cpan.org) or from the ftnpl project
		at Sourceforge.
