To Do
======




lib/FTN/SRIF.pm
----------------
- Add documentation of the 'Perl for FTN Systems' project at SourceForge. 

- Change to using a 3 parameter version of open() for the SRIF file.

- Does reading the Sysop field require needing to allow more than one space?


bin/ftn-srif
-------------
- Log files that are being requested.

- Create a results message as a text file.

- Use "freqerr.txt" as a paragraph to be included in the results message,
to indicate files that could not be found, instead of it being an entire
msg?   Or as part of a response sentance for each file requested?
  
- Read through a magic file list (magic.txt) for matches, & send any files
found.  If not found there, search through an okfiles.txt file for the
file being requested.

- Add a configurable option to return an FTN packet file instead of just
the default of sending the results message back as a text file.  Make it
a generic call to a external program for creating the packet.

- Add a configurable option to set the logging ID ($log_id)?

- Add a configurable option to save a copy of the SRIF if debug is set?

- Add a configurable option to log the command line if debug is set?

- Set debug option in configuration file instead of in script.  Default to set?

- Change to using a 3 parameter version of open() for file opens.

- Getting an extra newline (at least on a Linux system) when logging the name
of the request file, when logging that the request file is being read, and when
logging the name of the response file.

- The removal of the request file is apparantly not working but there is no
error being generated either.

- Rename to reflect that it is an SRIF processor explicitly for file requests?
